Design Patterns

The project incorporates the following design patterns:

    Builder Pattern: This pattern is used to create complex game objects step by step, allowing flexible object creation and avoiding constructors with numerous parameters.

    Abstract Factory Pattern: It provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. In the game project, this pattern is utilized to create  different types of game objects with a common interface.

    Singleton Pattern: This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the game and provides a global access point to that instance. It is used to manage game-wide settings and resources.
